After Devconnect, your Turkish friends are offering you an opportunity to extend your visit in Turkey to a unique location: the Nesin Mathematics Village. Situated among the mountains in Western Turkey, this non-profit village is dedicated to mathematics, philosophy, and the arts.

This retreat offers a change of pace, where people can unwind after Devconnect and actually delve into deeper discussions. Participants will be able to rest, discover Western Turkey, discuss ideas in an uninterrupted setting, and get to know a prominent math community in Turkey.

We are targeting a modest participant count (around 30), with priority given to researchers and engineers who are currently working on crypto-related technical projects. University students studying related fields are also welcome to attend.

Yiğit Kılıçoğlu is the main organizer, and he has been to the Village many times before. He is receiving extensive support from several organizations. The names of these organizations will be announced in the near future.

**If you are potentially interested in joining this retreat, please let us know by filling out the {{< link src="https://forms.gle/bvfUbDNhGPeg3GCR6" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}interest form{{< /link >}}. Expressing interest does not entail a firm commitment, but it will assist us in making necessary arrangements with the Village.**

## Dates

Participants will be able to arrive starting on 19 November, and we will be leaving the Village on 23 November. Coming to the Village on 20 November and/or leaving early is acceptable. The trip date might later be extended for interested participants.

## Location and Accommodation

The retreat will take place in the {{< link src="https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/main-page/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Nesin Mathematics Village{{< /link >}} , a non-profit village dedicated to math, philosophy and the arts. It's a picturesque place not far from the {{< link src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesus" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}ancient city of Ephesus{{< /link >}} and the {{< link src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Artemis" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Temple of Artemis{{< /link >}}, one of Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It is like Smurfs but with math. Classes run the entire year (check the {{< link src="https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/events/2023-nmk-undergraduate-and-graduate-summer-camp/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}summer undergraduate/graduate program{{< /link >}}). This retreat will be an {{< link src="https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/organise-an-event/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}independent event{{< /link >}} in the Village. For a firsthand story of the Village, check out Ali Nesin’s {{< link src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI4RwMmLQHQ" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Leelavati Prize Lecture{{< /link >}}.

We have reserved accommodation for 30 people, and are currently looking for funding. All accommodation is in the Village premises. Photos of the houses and dormitories can be found {{< link src="https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/gallery/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}here{{< /link >}}. All-inclusive prices (includes 3 meals) are as follows:
* Private room: ~60 USD per person.
* Room with double bed or two single beds: ~57 USD per person.
* "Dormitory" with many bunk beds: ~42 USD per person

## Travel

Travel from Istanbul to the Village will look like the following:
1. Take a train to Sabiha Gökçen Airport (SAW). There are also frequent flights from IST.
2. After an hour-long flight, land in İzmir Adnan Menderes Airport (ADB).
3. Take an hour-long train from ADB to Selçuk. Relevant trains can be found on the {{< link src="https://bilet.tcdd.gov.tr/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}TCDD website{{< /link >}} (from: Adnanmenderes Havaalanı, to: Selçuk).
4. Short minibus trip to the Village.

## Structure

Participants will virtually have complete freedom. While chalkboard math sessions and higher-level talks on current research topics will be encouraged, attendance at these activities will be entirely optional. We expect the main benefits of the retreat to come from the informal discussions between participants. The {{< link src="https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/library-catalogue/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}math library{{< /link >}} of the Village will be open to the participants. Additionally, we plan to organize a day trip to Ephesus and the nearby village of Şirince.

Topic suggestions for talks:
* Group theory for cryptography
* Proof systems
* Multi-party computation
* Newer cryptographic primitives (e.g. VDFs)
* Classical consensus mechanisms
