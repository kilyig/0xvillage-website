Hello friends of Ethereum,

After Devconnect, your Turkish friends are offering you an opportunity to extend your visit in Turkey to the non-profit [Nesin Mathematics Village](https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/main-page/), among the mountains in Western Turkey.

This program offers a change of pace, where people will be able to rest, discover Western Turkey, discuss ideas in an uninterrupted setting, and get to know a central hub of the Turkish math community. Instead of returning home right after Devconnect, come to the Nesin Village and hang out with us!

The long-term goal of this program is to start a long-lasting relationship between Ethereum and the Turkish math community that will enable many researchers from the region to discover web3. We will call this program a success if it leads to the organization of a series of Ethereum-related events in the Village and/or across the region.

We are targeting a modest participant count, with priority given to researchers, engineers and university students who work on or are interested in working on Ethereum.

This program is led by [Yiğit Kılıçoğlu](https://yigitkilicoglu.com) with [Nour Assili](https://nourassili.com/) from the [Blockchain Acceleration Foundation](https://www.blockchainacceleration.org/) as co-organizer. We thank [Ulaş Erdoğan](https://0xulas.eth.limo/) for his significant support.

**[Applications are now open!](https://forms.gle/wzvzbdRVc6pbpTXUA) Feel free to join our public [Telegram chat](https://t.me/+u6Mfogc8KtI0NWEx) where the organizers will be sharing updates and answering questions.**

## Reasons to come
* If you are a researcher or an engineer, you will be able to collaborate with other professionals in the field in a unique setting dedicated to academic research. You will also meet young and talented individuals who are interested in your work.
* If you are a younger participant, you will be able to find research groups that you can join, and learn about the latest challenges in the space. 
* The Math Village is active throughout the year. Professionals from a wide range of backgrounds regularly come to the Village to teach classes (check the [summer undergraduate/graduate program](https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/events/2023-nmk-undergraduate-and-graduate-summer-camp/)). Would you consider coming to the Village for a week or two over a summer and teach your area of expertise while holidaying? If yes, the 0xVillage is a great opportunity for you to get to know the Village and its people.
* Is your organization looking for a place to organize a research program? The Village might be a fitting place to do it. 0xVillage will give you a chance to see the resources that the Village offers. 
* If you were unable to present your work in past conferences, 0xVillage will be the perfect place for you to finally do it.
* Western Turkey is full of history and natural beauty.

## Dates

Participants will be able to arrive starting on 19 November, and we will be leaving the Village on 23 November. The trip date might later be extended for interested participants.

## Location and Accommodation

The program will take place in the [Nesin Mathematics Village](https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/main-page/), a non-profit village dedicated to math, philosophy and the arts. It's a picturesque place not far from the [ancient city of Ephesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesus) and the [Temple of Artemis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Artemis), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It is like Smurfs but with math. Classes run the entire year (check the [summer undergraduate/graduate program](https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/events/2023-nmk-undergraduate-and-graduate-summer-camp/)). This program will be an [independent event](https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/organise-an-event/) in the Village. For a firsthand story of the Village, check out Ali Nesin’s [Leelavati Prize Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI4RwMmLQHQ).

We have reserved accommodation for 30 people. All accommodation is in the Village premises. Photos of the houses and dormitories can be found [here](https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/gallery/). Daily prices (accommodation + 3 meals) are as follows:
* Private room: ~60 USD per person.
* Room with double bed or two single beds: ~49 USD per person.
* "Dormitory" with multiple bunk beds: ~42 USD per person

## Travel

Travel from Istanbul to the Village will look like the following:

1. Take a train to the Sabiha Gökçen Airport (SAW). Sabiha Gökçen is the last stop of the [M4 metro line](https://www.metro.istanbul/en/Hatlarimiz/HatDetay?hat=M4). There are also frequent flights from the Istanbul Airport (IST).
2. After an hour-long flight, land in the İzmir Adnan Menderes Airport (ADB).
3. Take an hour-long train from ADB to Selçuk. Relevant trains can be found on the [TCDD website](https://bilet.tcdd.gov.tr/) ("Nereden" (from): Adnanmenderes Havaalanı, "Nereye" (to): Selçuk).
4. Short minibus trip to Şirince.
5. The Village is 800 meters from the minibus stop at Şirince.

For other details, check out the Village's [guide](https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/how-to-get-here/).

## Structure

We expect the main immediate benefits of the program to come from the research talks and the informal discussions between participants. You could check the [vast collection](https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/library-catalogue/) of the math library, hang out with other participants while drinking Turkish tea, or explore the surrounding regions. It all depends on what you make of it. Researchers and engineers will be asked to give presentations regarding their research, but the exact format will be up for them to decide (the Village is known for its chalkboards). Other participants will be encouraged to share their work, too. A typical day will consist of a few talks before lunch and collaboration time in the afternoon. Importantly, participants of 0xVillage will be able to interact with the participants of other concurrent programs if there will be any. There will be no exhibit booths or distractions. Additionally, we are planning to organize a day trip to Ephesus and/or to the nearby village of Şirince.

Topic suggestions for talks:
* Group theory for cryptography
* Proof systems (e.g. Groth16)
* Multi-party computation / Homomorphic encryption
* Newer cryptographic primitives (e.g. VDFs)
* Classical consensus mechanisms
