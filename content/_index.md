0xVillage was a program at the [Nesin Math Village](https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/main-page/) in Western Turkey right after [Devconnect](https://devconnect.org) (19-23 November). Each day of the program featured research talks on crypto, but participants were also able to discover the surrounding regions and enjoy the setting and resources offered by the Village.

The following countries were represented at 0xVillage: Belgium, Canada, Egypt, France, Germany, Honduras, India, Iran, Japan, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, USA.

We had two main reasons for organizing 0xVillage:
* We wanted to start a long-lasting relationship between Ethereum and the Turkish math community that would enable many researchers from the region to discover web3. We will call this program a success if it leads to the organization of a series of web3-related events in the Village and/or across the region.
* There was a need for more web3 events that focused entirely on the tech, without any marketing or business components. The Math Village offered the uninterrupted setting that we were looking for.

## Next steps
We are currently exploring ways to organize a similar program in the future. In the meantime, feel free to join the [public Telegram group](https://t.me/+u6Mfogc8KtI0NWEx) where the next iterations of 0xVillage will be discussed.

## What is the Nesin Math Village?

The [Nesin Mathematics Village](https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/main-page/) is a non-profit village dedicated to math, philosophy and the arts. It's a picturesque place not far from the [ancient city of Ephesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesus) and the [Temple of Artemis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Artemis), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It is like Smurfs but with math. Classes run the entire year (check the [summer undergraduate/graduate program](https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/events/2023-nmk-undergraduate-and-graduate-summer-camp/)). 0xVillage was an [independent event](https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/organise-an-event/) in the Village. For a firsthand story of the Village, check out Ali Nesin’s [Leelavati Prize Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI4RwMmLQHQ).
